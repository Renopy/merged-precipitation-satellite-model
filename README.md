**ABSTRACT

Satellite precipitation have a lot of uncertainty and the spatial
resolution is still quite coarse. Hence, the purpose of this study is
to introduce a new approach based on multivariate linear modelling
and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the first time using
four multisource satellite precipitation products and some other
satellite data. Four different satellite precipitation products with
different algorithms, along with Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV)
and Land Surface Temperature (LST) data on a daily scale were
used (to benefit interactions of atmospheric content). Five linear
merge models, including five ANN models were introduced and
calibrated using harmony search algorithm. The performance of
the models was evaluated over Iran using observational rainfall
data of 2014 to 2020. The findings of this study highlighted that
the model based on ANN, which merged four rainfall products
together with LST and PWV has outperformed individual satellite
products and other presented models.
